# PenPot Limitations for NovyUI Automation

## üîé TL;DR

**PenPot automation is currently impractical for NovyUI design systems due to 4 critical limitations:**

1. **No Component Variants** ‚Üí Need 313 individual components instead of 18 with variants
2. **No Dynamic Token References** ‚Üí Must duplicate all components for light/dark themes *(plugin API only, manual GUI works)*
3. **Broken Layout System** ‚Üí Gap/padding properties don't work, requires complex spacer workarounds *(plugin API only, manual GUI works)*
4. **Limited Plugin API** ‚Üí Can't programmatically manage tokens or set theme-aware properties

**Bottom line**: 2-3x more manual work than expected, maintenance becomes nearly impossible due to hardcoded values. **Wait for component variants and better token API before attempting full automation.**

## üö® Critical Issues

### 1. **No Component Variants**
The biggest problem. Instead of 18 components with variants, you need 313 individual components. Button alone needs 36 separate components (6 variants √ó 6 states). Community calls this "the deciding factor for Figma vs PenPot."

**Workaround**: Create separate components with naming like "Button-Primary-Normal", "Button-Primary-Hover", etc.

### 2. **No Dynamic Token References (Plugin API)**
Can't set `{color.primary.7}` token references via plugin. Only hardcoded hex values work. This breaks the whole point of design tokens.

**Impact**: Must create duplicate components for light/dark themes. Everything is hardcoded.

```typescript
// ‚ùå Doesn't work
element.fills = [{ fillColor: "{color.primary.7}" }];

// ‚úÖ Only this works (but breaks theming)
element.fills = [{ fillColor: "#3B82F6" }]; // hardcoded
```

### 3. **Layout System Issues (Plugin API)**
Gap and padding properties don't work in the plugin API. Elements touch borders despite setting padding. Works fine in the GUI though.

**Workaround**: Use transparent spacer rectangles between elements.

```typescript
// ‚ùå Doesn't work
layout.gap = 16; 
layout.paddingLeft = 12; // elements still touch borders

// ‚úÖ Workaround
const spacer = penpot.createRectangle();
spacer.resize(12, height);
spacer.fills = []; // transparent
container.appendChild(spacer);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Other Issues

### **HTTPS/CORS Setup Pain**
Cloud PenPot needs HTTPS plugins, but the official templates use HTTP. You get cryptic CORS errors instead of clear "use HTTPS" messages.

**Fix**: Generate SSL cert and serve plugin over HTTPS.

### **API Authentication Weirdness**
Tokens are more secure but have limited functionality. Username/password gives full access. MCP servers had to use username/password because tokens can't export images.

### **Plugin Performance**
Plugins block the main browser thread during component creation. UI becomes unresponsive but doesn't break functionality.

## üóìÔ∏è What's Being Fixed

**Component Variants**: Active development happening (PRs #6051, #5876, #6131) but PenPot doesn't give timeline estimates. They say: *"When innovating, commitments can be tricky."*

**Token API**: No timeline for plugin improvements.

**Layout Issues**: Not acknowledged as bugs yet.

## üí° What Actually Works

- **Individual shape creation**: Basic plugin automation works fine
- **Design tokens in GUI**: PenPot has excellent W3C-compliant token system (just not via plugin API)
- **Manual layout**: Gap/padding work perfectly when done through the interface
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Well-documented with good examples

## üîß Current Workarounds

**Component Variants**: Name them "Button-Primary-Normal", "Button-Primary-Hover", etc.

**Token References**: Create everything twice - light theme container and dark theme container with hardcoded colors.

**Layout Spacing**: Use transparent spacer rectangles instead of gap/padding properties.

**HTTPS Setup**: Generate SSL cert and serve plugins over HTTPS (not documented in official guides).

PenPot automation for design systems isn't ready yet. The plugin API is too limited, and the missing component variants make it impractical. You'll spend 2-3x more time creating everything manually than using existing design system tools.

**Wait for**: Component variants support and better plugin API token management.

**Use now for**: Individual component creation or manual design work where PenPot's open-source nature matters more than automation efficiency.
