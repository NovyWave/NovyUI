### Accessibility
Accessibility features and requirements for Blockquote:
- Use semantic `<blockquote>` element.
- Provide citation or author information if available.
- Ensure sufficient contrast for quoted text and citation (WCAG AA compliant).
- Copy/expand actions (if present) must be keyboard accessible and have visible focus indicators.
- Blockquotes should be announced as quotes by screen readers (use `aria-label` or similar if needed).
- If blockquote is interactive, ensure ARIA roles/attributes are used appropriately.
