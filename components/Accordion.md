### Accessibility
Accessibility features and requirements for Accordion:
- Uses appropriate ARIA roles (`region`, `button`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`) for headers and panels.
- Supports keyboard navigation: users can move between headers with arrow keys and toggle with Enter/Space.
- Focus is managed so that only one header is tab-focusable at a time (roving tabindex pattern).
- Content panels are accessible to screen readers and hidden panels are not focusable.
- Ensures sufficient color contrast for text and icons (WCAG AA compliant).
- Focus indicators are visible and use the designated focus token.
