# Icon Tokens

This file defines all icon design tokens for NovyUI. All icon assets referenced here must exist in `/assets/icons/` and be versioned.

## Guidelines
- All icon files must be placed in `/assets/icons/` and referenced by filename.
- Use kebab-case for icon names and file names (e.g., `arrow-left.svg`).
- Use `.svg` format for all icons (Lucide icons are provided as SVGs).
- Add a new row to this table for each new icon, matching the file name and describing the icon.
- Update this file and add new rows when adding new icons.
- Ensure all icons listed are available as files.
- See enforcement scripts for required structure and validation.
- Reference the asset process in `todo-ai.md` for full workflow and conventions.
- All icons are sourced from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) and must retain their original names and attributions where required.
